Blockchain Domain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or  impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems  on the blockchain. As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is  filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together  in chronological order. The proposed system defines a novel innovative methodology for  creating of new blocks in the blockchain network. The proposed system is autonomous of any  existing blockchain platform and truly open to future enhancement. The proposed application  can be implemented for any other e-record information which needs protection against  tampering and misused. This proposed system offers the reliable and efficient access to  Vaccine information by citizens, Issuing Authority, and third parties, while preserving the  citizen private information.
